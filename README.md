# About Me
<details>
  <summary>Click to expand!</summary>

Greetings! My name is Caitlyn Carney, and I am currently a student at Codeup in their data-science program. I previously worked for Marriott International as a "Data Specialist". From there I returned to school and recieved an associates in science before coming to codeup. So you can come to a reasonable hypothesis that data is my life! 

I am really enjoying learning everything I can in data science! However, I am definitely drawn to the visual side of it! I find myself playing in seaborn, matplotlib, and starting to play in Tableau alot! I also really enjoy makig presentations to really catch and keep the audiences attention! My other favorite thing I have so far learned is cleaning data, I don't know what it is but it is very theraputic to sit down and make data easy to read and understand.

On my free time I enjoy relaxing with a nice book, playing some games on my pc, and playing with my dogs (my husky puppy, April, is so sweet! üê∫ ‚ù§Ô∏èüêæ).

### [Predicting Coding Languages:](https://github.com/CaitlynCarney/coding_language_prediction)
I used GitHub‚Äôs API and python‚Äôs BeautifulSoup to acquire verbiage from over 100 different "Doctor Who" inspired README files on GitHub. I used Natural Language Processing Techniques to prepare my text data for exploration and create a model to predict the repository language based on my text-based features. After exploring words, word combination, and their repetition I created a variety of models; finding that the SGD classifier model out performed all the others. This model beat my baseline accuracy of 39.5% by 14.3%, with an overall accuracy of 43.8%.

    
### [Predicting Video Game Success:](https://github.com/CaitlynCarney/video_game_sales)
I used a video game sales dataset, narrowing my subset to games which have sold 100,000 copies or more, to discover drivers for the success of a game. In my exploratory analysis, I used chi-square testing to identify features that might be drivers and found three that aided my Ridge Classifier model in predicting successful games. These drivers consisted of the games primary genre, release year, and primary gaming platform.
    
### [Reducing Log Error:](https://github.com/Zillow-Project/zillow_project_2021)
My partner and I aimed to determine drivers of logerror for Zillow's zestimate scores. We acquired data through SQL's zillow database. We used python libraries to explore our hypotheses and made clusters to create new features and applied to a linear regression models. After exploring and modeling we found that north LA, Ventura, tax values, and home quality are the main drivers of log error.
    
### [Predicting Customer Churn:](https://github.com/CaitlynCarney/prediting_home_values)
I used the Zillow database in SQL to acquire the needed data. Using this data I created multiple regression models to predict property values as accurately as possible. I found that the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, and the square footage of the home, were the 3 primary drivers of pricing. Using the information gathered, I created and presented an eye-catching slide deck that could be easily consumed by a stakeholder. 
    
### [Predicting Zillow Property Values:](https://github.com/CaitlynCarney/predicting_churn)
With the goal to find the primary drivers of customer churn within a hypothetical company, I worked through the data science pipeline and was able to create a model with a 80% accuracy with a baseline of 73%. I found that monthly charges, tenure, fiber optics, electronic check payers, and customers with no internet service were the top drivers of churn.
